# Configuration of c_cpp_properties.json file

## Why configure this file?

The [C/C++ Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) is used to provide C and C++ syntax highlights, code navigation and Go to declaration/definition within C and C++ files.

The file is located in {PROJECT_DIR}/.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json and can be generated by using **Create ESP-IDF Project** command.

## Default configuration

With this configuration, the Intellisense engine of the C/C++ extension will include all header files found by performing a recursive search of the `${config:idf.espIdfPath}/components` folder. Both **Default** and **Tag Parser** engines are supported. An example configuration that should work with most projects is shown below.

```
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Linux",
            "cStandard": "c11",
            "cppStandard": "c++17",
            "includePath": ["${config:idf.espIdfPath}/components/**"],
            "browse": {
                "path": [
                    "${config:idf.espIdfPath}/components"
                ],
                "limitSymbolsToIncludedHeaders": false   
            }
        }
    ],
    "version": 4
}
```

## Configuration with compile_commands.json

For this configuration, you must build your project beforehand in order to generate `${workspaceFolder}/build/compile_commands.json` (where ${workspaceFolder} is your project directory). This file will then be used to resolve your C/C++ headers.

```
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Linux",
            "cStandard": "c11",
            "cppStandard": "c++17",
            "compileCommands": "${workspaceFolder}/build/compile_commands.json"
        }
    ],
    "version": 4
}
```
