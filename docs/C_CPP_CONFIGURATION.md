# Configuration of c_cpp_properties.json file

## Why configure this file?

The [C/C++ Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) is used to provide C and C++ syntax highlights, code navigation and Go to declaration/definition within C and C++ files.

The file is located in {PROJECT_DIR}/.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json and can be generated by using **Create ESP-IDF Project** command.

## Default configuration without compile_commands.json

This configuration doesn't require the compile_commands.json file generated by build process but requires to use the Tag Parser IntelliSense engine of the C/C++ extension which will explore directories specified in `configurations[i].browse.path` array. An example configuration that should work with most projects is shown below.

```
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Linux",
            "cStandard": "c11",
            "cppStandard": "c++17",
            "includePath": ["${config:idf.espIdfPath}/components"],
            "browse": {
                "path": [
                    "${config:idf.espIdfPath}/components"
                ],
                "limitSymbolsToIncludedHeaders": false   
            }
        }
    ],
    "version": 4
}
```

You need to have `idf.espIdfPath` and set `C_Cpp.intelliSenseEngine` to **Tag Parser** in your Visual Studio Code Settings (Directly in `settings.json` or using the **Preferences:: Open Settings (UI)** command) to allow headers to be resolved by browsing the `${config:idf.espIdfPath}/components` folder.

## Configuration with compile_commands.json

For this configuration you need to build your project beforehand to generate a `${workspaceFolder}/build/compile_commands.json`, where ${workspaceFolder} is your project directory, to able to resolve your C/C++ headers.

```
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Linux",
            "cStandard": "c11",
            "cppStandard": "c++17",
            "compileCommands": "${workspaceFolder}/build/compile_commands.json",
        }
    ],
    "version": 4
}
```
