# Heap Tracing

Heap Tracing allows tracing of code which allocates/frees memory. More information in [Heap tracing documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-reference/system/heap_debug.html#heap-tracing). Please also review [System behaviour analysis](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/app_trace.html#system-behavior-analysis-with-segger-systemview) for systemView tracing configuration.

Let's open a ESP-IDF project. For this tutorial we will use the `system/sysview_tracing_heap_log` example.

1. Click menu View -> Command Palette... and search for the **ESP-IDF: Show Examples Projects** command and choose `Use Current ESP-IDF (/path/to/esp-idf)`. If you doesn't see the option, please review the setup in [Install tutorial](./install.md).

2. A window will be open with a list a projects, go the **system** section and choose the `sysview_tracing_heap_log`. You will see a **Create Project Using Example sysview_tracing_heap_log** button in the top and a description of the project below. Click the button and the project will be opened in a new window.

For this example, the project has been already configured for application tracing purposes. For more information please take a look at the [Application Level Tracing library documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/app_trace.html).

3. Configure, build and flash your project as explained in the [Basic use tutorial](./basic_use.md).

4. Click the `ESP-IDF Explorer` in the [Activity bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface). On the `ESP-IDF APP TRACER` section, click the `Start Heap Trace`. This will execute the extension's OpenOCD server and send the corresponding tracing commands to generate a tracing log. You can see the generated tracing log in the `APP TRACE ARCHIVES` named with `Heap Trace Log #1`. Each time you execute `Start Heap Trace` a new tracing will be generated and shown in the archives list. You can also start tracing by running the **ESP-IDF: App Trace** command.

> **NOTE:** The OpenOCD server output is shown in menu `View` -> Output -> ESP-IDF.

> **NOTE:** Make sure that OspenOCD configuration files are properly configured as described in [Debugging tutorial](./debugging.md).

5. Click on `Heap Trace Log #1` and choose the `Heap Tracing` option for `ESP-IDF Tracing` report window. Click `Show Report` button to reload the visualization.
