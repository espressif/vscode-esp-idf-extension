# CMakeLists.txt editor

When you right click on any CMakeLists.txt file this extension provides a custom CMakeLists.txt Editor to fill an ESP-IDF Project and Component registration as specified in:

- [ESP-IDF Project CMakeLists.txt](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/build-system.html#project-cmakelists-file)
- [ESP-IDF Component CMakeLists.txt files](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/build-system.html#component-cmakelists-files)

You need to choose which kind of CMakeLists.txt file (project or component) to edit. There is 2 types of input, one is a simple string and another is an array of strings, such as Component Sources (SRCS).

> **NOTE:** All inputs are described in the [CMakeLists.txt schema](../../cmakeListsSchema.json).

> **NOTE** This editor doesn't support all CMake functions and syntaxes. This editor should only be used for simple CMakeLists.txt options such as component registration (using idf_component_register) and basic project elements. If you need more customization or advanced CMakeLists.txt, consider reviewing [ESP-IDF Build System](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/build-system.html). Also review [CMakeLists.txt editor schema](../../cmakeListsSchema.json) for a list of supported code.

**THIS WILL OVERRIDE ANY EXISTING CODE IN THE FILE WITH THE ONE GENERATED IN THE EDITOR. IF YOU HAVE ANY CODE NOT INCLUDED IN THE [SCHEMA](../../cmakeListsSchema.json) (OR SINGLE LINE COMMENTS) USE A REGULAR TEXT EDITOR INSTEAD**

For this tutorial we will use the get-started's blink example as configured in [basic use tutorial](./basic_use.md).

1. Right click the `<project_path>/blink/CMakeLists.txt`, click on `ESP-IDF: CMakeLists.txt editor` and select `Project CMakeLists.txt`.

2. We can add new elements by selecting them from the `New Element` dropdown and clicking the `add` button. For simplicity we will just change the project name and save changes with the `Save` button.

We can observe when we re-open the file in a regular text-editor changes are reflected.

3. Now let's create a new ESP-IDF component in this project to modify its `CMakeLists.txt`. Click menu `View` -> `Command Palette`, type **ESP-IDF: Create new ESP-IDF Component** and enter the new component name.

4. A new component will be created in `<project_path>/blink/components/<component_name>`. Opening in the regular text editor, the user will see an `idf_component_register` method with:

```
idf_component_register(SRCS "my_component.c"
                       INCLUDE_DIRS "include")
```

Right click on `<project_path>/blink/components/<component_name>/CMakeLists.txt`, click on `ESP-IDF: CMakeLists.txt editor` and select `Component CMakeLists.txt`.

</p>

5. Observe that some fields are of array types such as **Component Sources (SRCS)** since we can add several paths while other are just string input fields (as described in cmakeListsSchema.json).

> **NOTE:** While using this extension, source files are added and deleted automatically from the same directory where CMakeLists.txt is located without user intervention.

6. Add a new element `Public component requirements for the component (REQUIRES)` and click the `add` button. A new array field will appear.

7. As described in [ESP-IDF Component CMakeLists.txt files](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/build-system.html#component-cmakelists-files), `REQUIRES` is used to list the component dependencies. Type `mbedtls` and click the `+` button (can also press enter on typing).

8. Click on `save` button and close the CMakeLists.txt editor. If you open `<project_path>/blink/components/<component_name>/CMakeLists.txt` on a regular text editor, the user will see:

```
idf_component_register(SRCS "my_component.c"
                       INCLUDE_DIRS "include"
                       REQUIRES "mbedtls")
```

9. Check [ESP-IDF Project CMakeLists.txt](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/build-system.html#project-cmakelists-file) and [ESP-IDF Component CMakeLists.txt files](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/build-system.html#component-cmakelists-files) for additional fields information.
