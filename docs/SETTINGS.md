# ESP IDF Settings

This extension contributes the following settings that can be later updated in settings.json or from VSCode Settings Preference menu (menu View -> Command Palette -> Preferences: Open Settings (UI)).

> **NOTE:** Please consider that `~`, `%VARNAME%` and `$VARNAME` are not recognized when set on ANY of this extension configuration settings. You can instead set any environment variable in the path using a `${env:VARNAME}` such as `${env:HOME}` or you can refer to other configuration parameter path with `${config:SETTINGID}` such as `${config:idf.espIdfPath}`.

The `idf.saveScope` allows the user to specify where to save settings when using commands such as `Configure Paths`, `Device configuration`, `Set Espressif device target` and other commands. Possible values are Global (User Settings), Workspace and WorkspaceFolder. For more information please take a look at [Working with multiple projects](./MULTI_PROJECTS.md). Use the `Select where to save configuration settings` command to choose where to save settings when using this extension commands.

> **NOTE:** All settings can be applied to Global (User Settings), Workspace and WorkspaceFolder unless Scope is specified.

This is how the extension uses them:

1. `idf.customExtraPaths` is pre-appended to your system environment variable PATH within Visual Studio Code **(not modifying your system environment)** before executing any of our extension commands such as `openocd` or `cmake` (i.e. build your current project) else extension commands will try to use what is already in your system PATH.
   > **NOTE:** In **ESP-IDF: Configure ESP-IDF extension** you can download ESP-IDF Tools or skip IDF Tools download and manually enter all required ESP-IDF Tools as explain in [SETUP](./SETUP.md) which will be saved in `idf.customExtraPaths`.
2. `idf.customExtraVars` stores any custom environment variable such as OPENOCD_SCRIPTS, which is the openOCD scripts directory used in openocd server startup. These variables are loaded to this extension commands process environment variables, choosing the extension variable if available, else extension commands will try to use what is already in your system PATH. **This doesn't modify your system environment outside Visual Studio Code.**
3. `idf.espIdfPath` (or `idf.espIdfPathWin` in Windows) is used to store ESP-IDF directory path within our extension. We override Visual Studio Code process IDF_PATH if this value is available. **This doesn't modify your system environment outside Visual Studio Code.**
4. `idf.pythonBinPath` (or `idf.espIdfPathWin` in Windows) is used to executed python scripts within the extension. In **ESP-IDF: Configure ESP-IDF extension** we first select a system-wide python executable from which to create a python virtual environment and we save the executable from this virtual environment in `idf.pythonBinPath`. All required python packages by ESP-IDF are installed in this virtual environment, if using **ESP-IDF: Configure ESP-IDF extension**
5. `idf.gitPath` (or `idf.gitPathWin` in Windows) is used in the extension to clone ESP-IDF master version or the additional supported frameworks such as ESP-ADF, ESP-MDF and Arduino-ESP32.

> **NOTE**: From Visual Studio Code extension context, we can't modify your system PATH or any other environment variable. We use a modified process environment in all of this extension tasks and child processes which should not affect any other system process or extension. Please review the content of `idf.customExtraPaths` and `idf.customExtraVars` in case you have issues with other extensions.

## Board/ Chip Specific Settings

These settings are specific to the ESP32 Chip/ Board

| Setting                                          | Description                                                                      | Scope                     |

This is how the extension uses them:

1. `idf.adapterTargetName` is used to select the chipset (esp32, esp32s2, esp32s3, esp32c3 and custom) on which to run the extension commands.
   > **NOTE** When you use the command **ESP-IDF: Set Espressif device target** it will override `idf.adapterTargetName` with selected chip and `idf.openOcdConfigs` with its default OpenOCD Configuration files.
   >
   > > If you want to customize the `idf.openOcdConfigs` alone, you can modify your user settings.json or use **ESP-IDF: Device configuration** and select `Enter OpenOCD Configuration File Paths list` by entering each file separated by comma ",".
2. `idf.customAdapterTargetName` is used when `idf.adapterTargetName` is set to `custom`.
3. `idf.flashBaudRate` is the baud rate value used for the **ESP-IDF: Flash your project** command and [ESP-IDF Debug](./DEBUGGING.md).
   > **NOTE** The ESP-IDF Monitor default baud rate value is taken from your project's skdconfig `CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_MONITOR_BAUD` (idf.py monitor' baud rate). This value can be override by setting the environment variable `IDF_MONITOR_BAUD` or `MONITORBAUD` in your system environment variables or this extension's `idf.customExtraVars` configuration setting.
4. `idf.openOcdConfigs` is used to store an string array of openOCD scripts directory relative path config files to use with OpenOCD server. (Example: ["interface/ftdi/esp32_devkitj_v1.cfg", "board/esp32-wrover.cfg"]). More information [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/jtag-debugging/tips-and-quirks.html#jtag-debugging-tip-openocd-configure-target).
5. `idf.port` (or `idf.portWin` in Windows) is used as the serial port value for the extension commands.
6. `idf.openOcdDebugLevel`: Log level for openOCD server output from 0 to 4.
7. `idf.openOcdLaunchArgs`: Launch arguments string array for openOCD. The resulting openOCD launch command looks like this: `openocd -d${idf.openOcdDebugLevel} -f ${idf.openOcdConfigs} ${idf.openOcdLaunchArgs}`.

## Use of environment variables in ESP-IDF settings.json and tasks.json

Environment (env) variables and other ESP-IDF settings (config) current values strings can be used in other ESP-IDF setting as `${env:VARNAME}` and `${config:ESPIDFSETTING}`, respectively.

Example : If you want to use `"~/esp/esp-idf"` you can set the value of `idf.espIdfPath` to `"${env:HOME}/esp/esp-idf"`.
