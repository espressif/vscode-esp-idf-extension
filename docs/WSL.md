# Using this extension on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Please review [Debugging using WSL](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/remote-extensions#debugging-using-wsl) in Visual Studio Code documentation to learn how to access the WSL system from Visual Studio Code.

> **NOTE**: On WSL 1 serial ports are available so the behavior doesn't change from regular extension use.

This extension was tested in Windows 10 Build 19041 with the Microsoft's Ubuntu 20.04 distribution for WSL 2.

Currently in WSL 2, there is no access to serial ports. Calling `powershell.exe` from distribution's shell we obtain serial ports and perform flash and monitor tasks when `WSL_DISTRO_NAME` environment variable is defined and `idf.wslEnable` is true.

## WSL 2 extension setup

1. Install ESP-IDF requirements for linux (also pip and venv which doesn't come by default on microsoft WSL distribution of Ubuntu).

```
sudo apt-get install git wget flex bison gperf python3-pip python3-venv python3-setuptools cmake ninja-build ccache libffi-dev libssl-dev dfu-util
```

> **NOTE:** The user might need to install/update pip in the virtual environment like: `$IDF_TOOLS_PATH/python_env/idfX.X_pyX.X_env/bin/python ./get-pip.py` where X.X are IDF and python major-minor versions respectively.

2. Configure the extension as explained in [SETUP](./SETUP.md) documentation or the [Install](./tutorial/install.md) tutorial.

   > **NOTE:** Running the setup from WSL could override the Windows host machine configuration settings since it is using the User Settings by default. Consider saving settings to a workspace or workspace folder as described in the [working with multiple projects document](./MULTI_PROJECTS.md).

3. Create an ESP-IDF project and use extension features.

## Limitations

- Currently Python is also required in Windows machine and available in environment PATH as `python`.
- Based on build 17063, sharing environment variables between WSL and Windows is done with a single environment variable `WSLENV` which translates WSL paths to Windows paths and viceversa. We have tried to include tools like `xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc` in PATH without success. (If you can make it work, please consider adding a contribution with a [pull request](./CONTRIBUTING.md)). This issue makes certain features not to work in WSL like `xtensa-esp32-elf-addr2line` in ESP-IDF Monitor.
