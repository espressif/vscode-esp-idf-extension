# Heap Tracing for ESP Chips

In this Heap tracing guide, we will follow the [**sysview_tracing_heap_log**](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/system/sysview_tracing_heap_log) example project which can be obtained from Github, this project need some configuration from menuconfig and also some jumpers to be set in your devkit.

## Prerequisites

## Steps

- Inside VSCode at left hand side, you will see Espressif Logo, click on that
- Click on the `Start heap tracing` button
- It will prompt you to launch `OpenOCD` (if not already running), you need to allow it to launch OpenOCD
- Once `OpenOCD` is launched, it will connect with OpenOCD using `TCL` at `localhost:6666`
- If everything is a success till now, it will send instruction to capture heap trace from your chip

## Results

Once heap tracing is done `Stop heap tracing` button will change the state to `Start Heap Tracing` again and you will be notified, now here are steps for how to parse your result and view the same.

- Inside `App Trace Archives` Section, your result will be present as archive
