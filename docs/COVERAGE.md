## Using Gcov and Gcovr to provide code coverage

# Requirements

Your ESP-IDF project should be configured to generate gcda/gcno coverage files using gcov. Please take a look at the [ESP-IDF gcov example](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/system/gcov) to see how to set up your project.

This extension also requires `gcovr` to generate JSON and HTML reports from generated files. This is installed as part of this extension ESP-IDF Debug Adapter Python requirements when following the **ESP-IDF: Configure ESP-IDF extension** command.
Please take a look at [ONBOARDING](./docs/ONBOARDING.md) for more information.

Make sure you had properly configure xtensa toolchain in `idf.customExtraPaths` or in your environment variable PATH since the gcov executable used is `xtensa-esp32-elf-gcov` and `gcovr` exists in the same directory as your `${idf.pythonBinPath}` path.

## Editor Coverage

For the text editor highlighting, we use execute a child process with `gcovr -r . --gcov-executable xtensa-eslp-elf-gcov --json`. This assumes you had configure your extension with Xtensa toolchain in `idf.customExtraPaths` and installed the `gcovr` from Debug adapter's python requirements.

For the text editor, we use the json object generated by the previous command to highlight each line if it is covered or if it is not. We don't highlight noncode lines.

You can customize highlight color using the extension settings. Visual Studio code support `"red"`, `rgb(255,0,120)` or `rgba(120,0,0,0.1)`.

- Covered lines use `idf.coveredLightTheme` for light themes and `idf.coveredDarkTheme` for dark themes.
- Partially covered lines use `idf.partialLightTheme` for light themes and `idf.partialDarkTheme` for dark themes.
- Non-covered lines use `idf.uncoveredLightTheme` for light themes and `idf.uncoveredDarkTheme` for dark themes.

## HTML report

We execute a child process with command `gcovr -r . --gcov-executable xtensa-eslp-elf-gcov --html` for the HTML report. This assumes you had configure your extension with Xtensa toolchain in `idf.customExtraPaths` and installed the `gcovr` from Debug adapter's python requirements.

With the generated HTML, we generate a Webview Panel with report from `gcovr`.
