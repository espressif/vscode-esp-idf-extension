# Onboarding ESP-IDF Extension

When you start ESP-IDF extension, the onboarding window can help you set up ESP-IDF, ESP-IDF Tools and their Python requirements to easily start working on your projects.

## Prerequisites

Install [ESP-IDF Prerequisites](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html#step-1-install-prerequisites) for your operating system.

For this extension you also need [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/download) and [Git](https://www.python.org/downloads). If you are on MacOS and Linux, you also need to preinstall [CMake](https://cmake.org/download) and [Ninja-build](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases) (and add them to `idf.customExtraPaths` in Step 4). For Windows users, CMake and Ninja are downloaded in step 3 Tools Downloads.

## Installed ESP-IDF following the Espressif documentation and want to reuse it in the extension.

If you installed ESP-IDF and ESP-IDF Tools following [ESP-IDF Get Started](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) then you can configure the extension following these steps:

### Directly modify settings.json

1. In Visual Studio Code press F1 and type "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)". This will open your user global settings for Visual Studio Code. You could choose to modify your workspace settings.json if you want these settings for a specific workspace or within a specific project .vscode/settings.json.
2. Your settings.json should look like:

```
{
    ...,
    "idf.espIdfPath": "path/to/esp-idf",
    "idf.customExtraPaths": "UPDATED_PATH",
    "idf.customExtraVars": "{\"OPENOCD_SCRIPTS\":\"OPENOCD_FOLDER/share/openocd/scripts\"}",
    "idf.pythonBinPath": "PYTHON_INTERPRETER",
    "idf.port": "DEVICE_PORT",
    "idf.openOcdConfigs": [
        "interface/ftdi/esp32_devkitj_v1.cfg",
        "board/esp32-wrover.cfg"
    ],
}
```

where UPDATED_PATH is the "Updated PATH variable" generated by `$IDF_PATH/export.sh`, PYTHON_INTERPRETER is the "Using Python interpreter in" generated by `$IDF_PATH/export.sh`, the device port is your device serial port (COM1, /dev/cu.usbserial-1433401, etc) and idf.openOcdConfigs are the config files used for OpenOCD for your device (they are relative to OPENOCD_SCRIPTS directory).

### Using Preferences: Open Settings (UI)

This is the same as previous sections but the name of each configuration setting is the description given in the [Readme ESP-IDF Settings section](./../README.md).

### Using ESP-IDF: Configure ESP-IDF extension window

Follow the next section steps without downloading the ESP-IDF Tools. On Step 3, Skip Tools download and manually set them. First set PYTHON_INTERPRETER in the first input, UPDATED_PATH in the second input (make sure CMake and Ninja-build directories are part of these paths) and the correct value for OPENOCD_SCRIPTS (replace \${TOOL_PATH} with OpenOCD directory) as well as other variables shown.

## How to configure this extension from zero using ESP-IDF: Configure ESP-IDF extension window

1. Press **START** on the onboarding window and check that git is installed. Also select the Python executable to use in this extension. The python executable is persisted for the current onboarding session to create a python virtual environment in step 3, sub-item 1.

2. Go to **Configure ESP-IDF** to download ESP-IDF or select an existing ESP-IDF folder in your system. In this window you can select the version you wish to download and the path to install it or you can select ESP-IDF directory, which will be validated. This path is saved as `idf.espIdfPath` which is used to replace system environment variable `IDF_PATH` (inside Visual Studio Code only) before running extension commands.

3. Go to **Configure ESP-IDF Tools** will allow you to download required ESP-IDF Tools or manually set them.

   1. If you are downloading them, choose the directory where to install them (Default directory is **\$HOME/.espressif** for Linux/MacOS users or **%USER_PROFILE%\.espressif** for Windows users) which will saved as `idf.toolsPath`. After installing the ESP-IDF Tools, a python virtual environment will be created for ESP-IDF in **\${`idf.toolsPath`}/python_env** and the virtualenv python full path executable will be saved in `idf.pythonBinPath` or `idf.pythonBinPathWin` for Windows users. **This python executable will be used to execute all python dependent commands in this ESP-IDF extension**. After you download the ESP-IDF Tools, their bin folder directories will be set in `idf.customExtraPaths` and their required environment variables in `idf.customExtraVars` (such as OPENOCD_SCRIPTS).

4. The next step is to verify each installed tool version is correct for the `idf.espIdfPath` ESP-IDF. If you skipped ESP-IDF tools download, you need to manually set each tool bin directory in `idf.customExtraPaths` by typing all required tools executable location separated by ; (Windows users) or : (Linux/MacOS users), the virtual environment python executable absolute path, which is saved in `idf.pythonBinPath` and is used to test all ESP-IDF requirements.txt are fulfilled as well; and the `idf.customExtraVars` with correct values for environment variables such as OPENOCD_SCRIPTS, which is used to find the OpenOCD configuration files specified in `idf.openOcdConfigs`.

**DO NOT USE ~, \$HOME OR %USERPROFILE%, ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ARE NOT RESOLVED IN THIS CONFIGURATION SETTINGS.**. You could use `${env:HOME}` to refer to \$HOME (Linux/MacOS) or %HOME% (Windows).

An example python path for `idf.pythonBinPath` is _/home/myUser/.espressif/python_env/idf4.0_py3.5_env/bin/python_ for MacOS/Linux users or _C:\Users\myUser\.espressif\python_env\idf4.0_py3.5_env\Scripts\python.exe_ for Windows users.

For example if

- OpenOCD executable path is _/home/myUser/.espressif/tools/openocd/version/openocd-esp32/bin/openocd_ or _C:\Users\myUser\.espressif\tools\openocd\version\openocd-esp32\bin\openocd_ (Windows)
- XtensaEsp32 executable path is _/home/myUser/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp32/version/xtensa-esp32/bin/xtensa-esp32-gcc_ or _C:\Users\myUser\.espressif\tools\xtensa\version\xtensa-esp32\bin/xtensa-esp32-gcc_ (Windows)

you need to set in `idf.customExtraPaths`:

- _/home/myUser/\.espressif\tools\openocd\version\openocd-esp32\bin:/home/myUser//.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp32/version/xtensa-esp32/bin_ (Linux/MacOS users) or
- _C:\Users\myUser\.espressif\tools\openocd\version\openocd-esp32\bin;C:\Users\myUser\.espressif\tools\xtensa-esp32\version\xtensa-esp32\bin_ (Windows users).

`idf.customExtraVars` is an object saved in Visual Studio Code's settings.json that looks like this (**Make sure to replace \${TOOL_PATH} with the tool path**):

```
{
    ...,
    OPENOCD_SCRIPTS: "...",
    OTHER_ENV_VAR: "...",
    ...
}
```

The list of required `idf.customExtraVars` will be shown in the current step (Verify ESP-IDF Tools) and they should be filled for the extension to work properly.

5. After verifying ESP-IDF tools and required python packages, the extension has been configured correctly. An option to open **ESP-IDF: Show examples** is shown.

Here is diagram to configure ESP-IDF extension:

## Notes

If you try to download ESP-IDF in a directory where a folder esp-idf already exists an error will be shown. Please delete this esp-idf folder or choose another destination directory.
