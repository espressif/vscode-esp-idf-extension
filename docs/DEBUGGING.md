# Configuration for Visual Studio Code Debug

> **NOTE:** Make sure to configure your drivers as mentioned in ESP-IDF [Configure JTAG Interface](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/jtag-debugging/configure-ft2232h-jtag.html) documentation.

> **NOTE:** Please take a look first at [ESP-IDF JTAG Debugging](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/jtag-debugging/index.html#how-it-works).
> OpenOCD typically uses port 4444 for Telnet communication, port 6666 for TCL communication and port 3333 for gdb.

The Visual Studio Code uses `.vscode/launch.json` to configure debug as specified in [Visual Studio Code Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations).

We recommend using our `Eclipse CDT GDB Adapter` configuration to debug your ESP-IDF projects, but you can configure launch.json for any GDB debugger extension like [Microsoft C/C++ Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) and [Native Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webfreak.debug). The ESP-IDF Debug adapter will be deprecated and removed in the next major release.

Our extension implements a `ESP-IDF: Peripheral View` tree view in the `Run and Debug` view which will use the SVD file defined in the `IDF SVD File Path (idf.svdFilePath)` configuration setting to be defined in the [settings.json](../SETTINGS.md) to populate a set of peripherals registers values for the active debug session target. You could find Espressif SVD files from [Espressif SVD](https://github.com/espressif/svd).

If `initCommands`, `gdbinitFile` or `initGdbCommands` are defined in launch.json, make sure to include the following commands for debug session to properly work as shown in [JTAG Debugging with command line](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/jtag-debugging/using-debugger.html#command-line).

## Using the Eclipse CDT GDB Debug Adapter

The Eclipse CDT team have published a GDB debug adapter as NPM package which we include in our extension dependencies. For more information about the debug adapter please review [CDT-GDB-Adapter Github Repository](https://github.com/eclipse-cdt-cloud/cdt-gdb-adapter).

The default configuration is:

```JSON
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "gdbtarget",
      "request": "attach",
      "name": "Eclipse CDT GDB Adapter"
    }
  ]
}
```

where required of the arguments are automatically defined and resolved by the extension itself.

In case you wants more customized control, the basic arguments in launch.json are:

```JSON
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "gdbtarget",
      "request": "attach",
      "name": "Eclipse CDT Remote",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/${command:espIdf.getProjectName}.elf",
      "initCommands": [
        "set remote hardware-watchpoint-limit {IDF_TARGET_CPU_WATCHPOINT_NUM}",
        "mon reset halt",
        "maintenance flush register-cache"
      ],
      "gdb": "${command:espIdf.getToolchainGdb}",
      "target": {
        "connectCommands": [
          "set remotetimeout 20",
          "-target-select extended-remote localhost:3333"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- `program`: ELF file of your project build directory to execute the debug session. The command `${command:espIdf.getProjectName}` will query the extension to find the current build directory project name.
- `initCommands`: GDB Commands to initialize GDB and target. The default value is `["set remote hardware-watchpoint-limit {IDF_TARGET_CPU_WATCHPOINT_NUM}", "mon reset halt", "maintenance flush register-cache"]`.
- `initialBreakpoint`: When `initCommands` is not defined, this command will add to default initCommands a hardward breakpoint at the given function name. For example `app_main`, the default value, will add `thb app_main` to default initCommmands. If set to "", an empty string, no initial breakpoint will be set and if let undefined it will use the default `thb app_main`.
- `gdb`: GDB executable to be used. By default `"${command:espIdf.getToolchainGdb}"` will query the extension to find the ESP-IDF toolchain GDB for the current `IDF_TARGET` of your esp-idf project (esp32, esp32c6, etc.).

> **NOTE** `{IDF_TARGET_CPU_WATCHPOINT_NUM}` is resolved by the extension according to the current `IDF_TARGET` of your esp-idf project (esp32, esp32c6, etc.).

Some additional arguments you might use are:

- `runOpenOCD`: (Default: true). Run extension OpenOCD Server.
- `verifyAppBinBeforeDebug`: (Default: false) Verify that current ESP-IDF project binary is the same as binary in chip.
- `logFile`: Absolute path to the file to log interaction with gdb. Example: `${workspaceFolder}/gdb.log`.
- `verbose`: Produce verbose log output.
- `environment`: Environment variables to apply to the ESP-IDF Debug Adapter. It will replace global environment variables and environment variables used by the extension.

```json
"environment": {
  "VAR": "Value"
}
```

- `imageAndSymbols`:

```json
"imageAndSymbols": {
  "symbolFileName": "If specified, a symbol file to load at the given (optional) offset",
  "symbolOffset": "If symbolFileName is specified, the offset used to load",
  "imageFileName": "If specified, an image file to load at the given (optional) offset",
  "imageOffset": "If imageFileName is specified, the offset used to load"
}
```

- `target`: Configuration for target to be attached. Specifies how to connect to the device to debug. Usually OpenOCD exposes the chip as a remote target on port `3333`.

```json
"target": {
  "type": "The kind of target debugging to do. This is passed to -target-select (defaults to remote)",
  "host": "Target host to connect to (defaults to 'localhost', ignored if parameters is set)",
  "port": "Target port to connect to (defaults to value captured by serverPortRegExp, ignored if parameters is set)",
  "parameters": "Target parameters for the type of target. Normally something like localhost:12345. (defaults to `${host}:${port}`)",
  "connectCommands": "Replace all previous parameters to specify an array of commands to establish connection"
}
```

Other arguments please review this extension's package.json `gdbtarget` debugger contribution.

## Use Microsoft C/C++ Extension to Debug

you can also use [Microsoft C/C++ Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) to debug, the community recommend this launch.json configuration:

```JSON
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "GDB",
      "type": "cppdbg",
      "request": "launch",
      "MIMode": "gdb",
      "miDebuggerPath": "${command:espIdf.getToolchainGdb}",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/${command:espIdf.getProjectName}.elf",
      "windows": {
        "program": "${workspaceFolder}\\build\\${command:espIdf.getProjectName}.elf"
      },
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "setupCommands": [
			  { "text": "set remotetimeout 20" },
		  ],
		  "postRemoteConnectCommands": [
			  { "text": "mon reset halt" },
			  { "text": "maintenance flush register-cache"},
		  ],
      "externalConsole": false,
      "logging": {
        "engineLogging": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

# Using NativeDebug

you can also try using the [Native Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webfreak.debug) extension with this example launch.json configuration:

```JSON
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "gdb",
      "request": "attach",
      "name": "NativeDebug",
      "target": "extended-remote :3333",
      "executable": "${workspaceFolder}/build/${command:espIdf.getProjectName}.elf",
      "gdbpath": "${command:espIdf.getToolchainGdb}",
      "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
      "autorun": [
        "mon reset halt",
        "maintenance flush register-cache",
        "thb app_main"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Use the ESP-IDF Debug Adapter

**DEPRECATED NOTICE**: We are deprecating the use of our ESP-IDF Debug Adapter in favor of using the Eclipse CDT GDB Adapter. It will removed from extension in the future major release.

This extension includes the [ESP-IDF Debug Adapter](https://github.com/espressif/esp-debug-adapter) which implement the debug adapter protocol (DAP) to communicate Xtensa's Toolchain and OpenOCD with Visual Studio Code allowing you to easily debug ESP-IDF applications. Visual Studio Code will:

1. Launch the debug adapter server in port `debugPort` given in launch.json if `mode` is `auto` or
2. Connect to existing debug adapter server in port `debugPort` if `mode` is `manual`.

Default values launch.json for ESP-IDF Debug Adapter:

```JSON
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "espidf",
      "name": "Launch-name",
      "request": "launch"
    }
  ]
}
```

The ESP-IDF Debug Adapter settings for launch.json are:

- `appOffset`: Program start address offset from where to start debugging.
- `debugPort`: Port for ESP-IDF Debug Adapter. Default: 43474.
- `env`: Environment variables to apply to the ESP-IDF Debug Adapter. It will replace global environment variables and environment variables used by the extension.
- `gdbinitFile`: Specify the gdbinit file to send to gdb. Example value: `"${workspaceFolder}/gdbinit"`.
  > **NOTE:** By default, the `gdbinit` file is generated automatically by the ESP-IDF Debug Adapter.
- `initGdbCommands`: One or more xtensa-esp32-elf-gdb commands to execute in order to setup the underlying debugger.
  > **NOTE**: If `gdbinitFile` is defined, these commands will be ignored.
- `logLevel`: Debug Adapter logging level (0-4), 5 - for a full OOCD log. Default: 2.
- `mode`: Can be either `auto`, to start the Debug Adapter and OpenOCD server within the extension or `manual`, to connect to an already running Debug Adapter and OpenOCD session. Default: auto.
  > **NOTE:** If set to `manual`, OpenOCD and ESP-IDF Debug Adapter have to be manually executed by you and the extension will just try to connect to existing servers at configured ports.
- `name`: The name of the debug launch configuration. This will be shown in the Run view (Menu View -> Run).
- `type`: Type of debug configuration. It **must** be `espidf`.
- `verifyAppBinBeforeDebug`: (Default `false`) If enabled the extension will verify that the current workspace folder `build/${project-name}.bin` is the same of the target device application. `${project-name}` is the name of the project (i.e blink) and is obtained from the `build/project_description.json`. Set this to `true` to add application binary validation before debug session.
- `tmoScaleFactor`: Scale factor for gdb timeout. Default: 1.

If `gdbinitFile` or `initGdbCommands` are defined in launch.json, make sure to include the following commands for debug session to properly work as shown in [JTAG Debugging with command line](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/jtag-debugging/using-debugger.html#command-line).

```
target remote :3333
set remote hardware-watchpoint-limit 2
mon reset halt
flushregs
thb app_main
c
```

Example launch.json for ESP-IDF Debug Adapter:

```JSON
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "espidf",
      "name": "Launch",
      "request": "launch",
      "debugPort": 9998,
      "logLevel": 2,
      "mode": "manual",
      "verifyAppBinBeforeDebug": false,
      "tmoScaleFactor": 1,
      "initGdbCommands": [
        "target remote :3333",
        "set remotetimeout 20",
        "symbol-file /path/to/program.elf",
        "mon reset halt",
        "maintenance flush register-cache",
        "thb app_main"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CUSTOM_ENV_VAR": "SOME_VALUE"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Output and Logs from ESP-IDF Debug Adapter and OpenOCD

Beside the Visual Studio Code Debug console output. You can find OpenOCD and the ESP-IDF debug adapter output in `<project_dir>/debug.log` and Menu View -> Output -> `ESP-IDF`.
