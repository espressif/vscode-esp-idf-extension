The **Add Arduino ESP32 as ESP-IDF Component** command will just add [Arduino ESP32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) at your current folder with in `${CURRENT_FOLDER}/components/arduino`. You can also use **Create ESP-IDF project** with the `arduino-as-component` template to create a new project folder that includes arduino as ESP-IDF component.

## ESP-IDF Configure extension

Initial configuration is done easily by executing **ESP-IDF: Configure ESP-IDF extension** Please take a look at [ONBOARDING](./docs/ONBOARDING.md) for more in-depth detail. This window is always shown when extension is activated which you can disable with `idf.showOnboardingOnInit`.

This windows helps you setup key Visual Studio Code configurations for this extension to perform included features correctly. This is how the extension uses them:

1. `idf.pythonBinPath` is used to executed python scripts within the extension. In **ESP-IDF: Configure ESP-IDF extension** we first select a system-wide python executable from which to create a python virtual environment and we save the executable from this virtual environment in `idf.pythonBinPath`. All required python packages by ESP-IDF are installed in this virtual environment, if using **ESP-IDF: Configure ESP-IDF extension**
2. `idf.customExtraPaths` is pre-appended to your system environment variable PATH within Visual Studio Code **(not modifying your system environment)** before executing any of our extension commands such as `openocd` or `cmake` (i.e. build your current project) else extension commands will try to use what is already in your system PATH. In **ESP-IDF: Configure ESP-IDF extension** you can download ESP-IDF Tools or skip IDF Tools download and manually enter all required ESP-IDF Tools as explain in [ONBOARDING](./docs/ONBOARDING.md) which will be saved in `idf.customExtraPaths`.
3. `idf.customExtraVars` stores any custom environment variable we use such as OPENOCD_SCRIPTS, which is the openOCD scripts directory used in openocd server startup. We add these variables to visual studio code process environment variables, choosing the extension variable if available, else extension commands will try to use what is already in your system PATH. **This doesn't modify your system environment outside Visual Studio Code.**
4. `idf.adapterTargetName` is used to select the chipset (esp32, esp32 s2, etc.) on which to run our extension commands.
5. `idf.openOcdConfigs` is used to store an array of openOCD scripts directory relative path config files to use with OpenOCD server. (Example: ["interface/ftdi/esp32_devkitj_v1.cfg", "board/esp32-wrover.cfg"]).
6. `idf.espIdfPath` is used to store ESP-IDF directory path within our extension. We override Visual Studio Code process IDF_PATH if this value is available. **This doesn't modify your system environment outside Visual Studio Code.**

**Note**: From Visual Studio Code extension context, we can't modify your system PATH or any other environment variable. We do override the current Visual Studio Code process environment variables which might collide with other extension you might have installed. Please review the content of `idf.customExtraPaths` and `idf.customExtraVars` in case you have issues with other extensions.

## ESP IDF Settings

This extension contributes the following settings that can be later updated in settings.json or from VSCode Settings Preference menu (F1 -> Preferences: Open Settings (UI)).

### ESP-IDF Specific Settings

These are the configuration settings that ESP-IDF extension contributes to your Visual Studio Code editor settings.

| Setting ID                 | Description                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `idf.espIdfPath`           | Path to locate ESP-IDF framework (IDF_PATH)                                   |
| `idf.toolsPath`            | Path to locate ESP-IDF Tools (IDF_TOOLS_PATH)                                 |
| `idf.pythonBinPath`        | Python absolute binary path used to execute ESP-IDF Python Scripts            |
| `idf.customExtraPaths`     | Paths to be appended to \$PATH                                                |
| `idf.customExtraVars`      | Variables to be added to system environment variables                         |
| `idf.useIDFKconfigStyle`   | Enable style validation for Kconfig files                                     |
| `idf.showOnboardingOnInit` | Show ESP-IDF Configuration window on extension activation                     |
| `idf.adapterTargetName`    | ESP-IDF target Chip (Example: esp32)                                          |
| `idf.openOcdConfigs`       | Configuration files for OpenOCD. Relative to OPENOCD_SCRIPTS folder           |
| `idf.saveBeforeBuild`      | Save all the edited files before building (default `true`)                    |
| `idf.coveredLightTheme`    | Background color for covered lines in light theme for gcov coverage           |
| `idf.coveredDarkTheme`     | Background color for covered lines in dark theme for gcov coverage            |
| `idf.partialLightTheme`    | Background color for partially covered lines in light theme for gcov coverage |
| `idf.partialDarkTheme`     | Background color for partially covered lines in dark theme for gcov coverage  |
| `idf.uncoveredLightTheme`  | Background color for uncovered lines in light theme for gcov coverage         |
| `idf.uncoveredDarkTheme`   | Background color for uncovered lines in dark theme for gcov coverage          |

When you use the command **ESP-IDF: Set Espressif device target** it will override `idf.adapterTargetName` with selected chip and `idf.openOcdConfigs` with its default OpenOCD Configuration files. If you want to customize the `idf.openOcdConfigs` alone, you can modify your user settings.json or use **ESP-IDF: Device configuration** and select `Enter OpenOCD Configuration File Paths list` by entering each file separated by comma ",".

### Board/ Chip Specific Settings

These settings are specific to the ESP32 Chip/ Board

| Setting        | Description                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `idf.port`     | Path of selected device port |
| `idf.baudRate` | Device Baud rate             |

### Log Tracing Specific Settings

These settings are specific to the Log Tracing

| Setting             | Description                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `trace.poll_period` | poll_period will be set for the apptrace |
| `trace.trace_size`  | trace_size will set for the apptrace     |
| `trace.stop_tmo`    | stop_tmo will be set for the apptrace    |
| `trace.wait4halt`   | wait4halt will be set for the apptrace   |
| `trace.skip_size`   | skip_size will be set for the apptrace   |

**NOTE:** Please consider that `~` and `$VAR` are not recognized when you set one of the previous path. You can instead set any environment variable in the path using a `${env:VARNAME}` such as `${env:HOME}` or you can refer to other configuration parameter path such as `${config:idf.espIdfPath}`.

### Use of environment variables in ESP-IDF settings.json and tasks.json

Environment (env) variables and other ESP-IDF settings (config) current values strings can be used in other ESP-IDF setting as `${env:VARNAME}` and `${config:ESPIDFSETTING}`, respectively.

Example : If you want to use `"~/esp/esp-idf"` you can set the value of `idf.espIdfPath` to `"${env:HOME}/esp/esp-idf"`.

## Available Tasks in tasks.json

There is also some tasks defined in Tasks.json, which can be executed by running <kbd>F1</kbd> and writing `Tasks: Run task` and selecting one of
the following:

1. `Build` - Build Project
2. `Set Target to esp32`
3. `Set Target to esp32s2`
4. `Clean` - Clean the project
5. `Flash` - Flash the device
6. `Monitor` - Start a monitor terminal
7. `OpenOCD` - Start the openOCD server
8. `BuildFlash` - Execute a build followed by a flash command.

Note that for OpenOCD tasks you need to define OPENOCD_SCRIPTS in your system environment variables with openocd scripts folder path.

## ESP-IDF GUI Menuconfig tool

This plugin includes a GUI menuconfig that reads your current project folder's sdkconfig file (if available, otherwise it would take default values) and start a configuration server process (confserver.py in **\${ESP-IDF-DIRECTORYPATH}**/tools) that enables the user to redefine ESP-IDF board parameters.

When the user modify a parameter value, the value is send to the confserver.py process, which return the new value and other values modified to GUI menuconfig and then update the values in the UI.

Values are not automatically saved to the sdkconfig file until you click save changes. You can cancel any changes and load the values from the sdkconfig file by clicking cancel changes. If you click set default the current sdkconfig file is replaced by a template sdkconfig file and then loaded into the GUI menuconfig rendered values.

The search functionality allows to find a parameter by description, i.e the name that appears in the sdkconfig file.

An IDF GUI Menuconfig log in Output is created to print all communications with `${idf.espIdfPath}\tools\confserver.py`. It can be be used to track any errors.

## Working with multiple projects

For big projects, a user will typically have one or more projects to build, flash or monitor. The ESP-IDF uses the [Visual Studio Code Workspace file schema](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_workspace-file-schema) to identify all projects folders inside the current workspace (which would be the root folder).

You can select the current project by clicking the **IDF Current Project** Item in the Visual Studio Code Status bar or by pressing F1 and typing **ESP-IDF: Pick a workspace folder for IDF commands** which will determine the folder where to obtain the ESP-IDF Settings such as current device USB port, ESP-IDF path, etc.

Projects folders and workspace level settings are defined in the `.code-workspace` file such as:

```json
{
  "folders": [
    {
      "path": "./project1"
    },
    {
      "path": "./project2"
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "idf.port": "/dev/ttyUSB1",
    "idf.espIdfPath": "${env:HOME}/esp/esp-idf"
  }
}
```

Settings in the root folder's `.code-workspace` can be used when your current project directory doesn't contain a `.vscode/settings.json` file.

If you want to open a project with multiple subprojects in Visual Studio Code, click Menu **File** then **Open Workspace** which will open a window to select the `.code-workspace` of your root project. You can either manually create this `.code-workspace` file and define all sub folders (projects) or when you click Menu **File** --> **Save Workspace as...** which doesn't automatically add any folder inside the current directory. You can add a folder to the workspace when you click Menu **File** --> **Add Folder to Workspace...**.

**NOTE:** You still need to manually select the debug configuration in the Debug tab that correspond to your current workspace folder. There is a project folder suffix on each debug configuration.

## Code Coverage

We provide editor code coverage highlight and HTML reports for ESP-IDF projects, if coverage files are generated on a ESP-IDF project's build directory. For more info please take a look at [Code Coverage](./docs/COVERAGE.md).

## Debugging

Click <kbd>F5</kbd> to start debugging. For correct debug experience, first `build`, `flash` your device and define the correct `idf.customExtraPaths` paths and `idf.customExtraVars` using [ONBOARDING](./docs/ONBOARDING.md).

When you start debug, an OpenOCD process starts in the background. OpenOCD Output log window is created in Visual Studio Code lower panel. To configure your project's launch.json to debug, please review [DEBUGGING](./docs/DEBUGGING.md).

## Log & Heap Tracing

We support [log](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/app_trace.html) and [heap tracing](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/system/heap_debug.html) out of the box, which enables users to perform log/heap tracing with just few button clicks and present the results of tracing data with UI.

You can follow [this](./docs/HEAP_TRACING.md) quick step-by-step guide for heap tracing.

## System View Tracing Viewer

We have provide a [system view tracing viewer](./docs/SYS_VIEW_TRACING_VIEWER.md) inside the vscode extension which will enable you to view the traces along with other relevant details.

## Kconfig files editor

When you open a `Kconfig`, `Kconfig.projbuild` or `Kconfig.in` file we provide syntax highlighting. If `idf.useIDFKconfigStyle` is enabled, we also provide ESP-IDF Kconfig style syntax validation such as indent validation and not closing blocks found (Example: menu-endmenu). Please review [Kconfig Formatting Rules](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-reference/kconfig.html) and [Kconfig Language](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/tools/kconfig/kconfig-language.txt) for further details about the ESP-IDF Kconfig formatting rules and Kconfig language in general.

## ESP Rainmaker Support

We support connecting, viewing and editing of ESP Rainmaker enabled devices out of the box, please [refer here](/docs/ESP_RAINMAKER.md) for more info
