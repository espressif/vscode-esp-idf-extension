Application Tracing
=========================

This feature allows to transfer arbitrary data between host and ESP32 via JTAG interface with small overhead on program execution.

Developers can use this library to send application specific state of execution to the host and receive commands or other type of info in the opposite direction at runtime.

Let's open a ESP-IDF project. For this tutorial we will use the `system/app_trace_basic <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/system/app_trace_basic>`_ example.

- Navigate to **View** > **Command Palette**.

- Type **ESP-IDF: New Project**, select the command and choose ESP-IDF version to use.

If you don't see the option, please review the setup in :ref:`Install ESP-IDF and Tools <installation>`.

- A window will be open with settings to configure the project. Later you can choose from the ESP-IDF examples, go the **system** section and choose the ``app_trace_basic``. You will see a **Create Project Using Example app_trace_basic project** button in the top and a description of the project below. Click the button and the project will be opened in a new window.

For this example, the project has been already configured for application tracing purposes. On other projects you need to enable ``CONFIG_APPTRACE_DEST_JTAG`` and ``CONFIG_APPTRACE_ENABLE`` with the **ESP-IDF: SDK Configuration Editor** command.

.. note::
  For the ``app_trace_basic`` example to work properly, you need to add the following settings to your project's ``.vscode/settings.json`` file:

  .. code-block:: json

    {
      "trace.poll_period": 0,
      "trace.trace_size": 2048,
      "trace.stop_tmo": 3,
      "trace.wait4halt": 0,
      "trace.skip_size": 0
    }

  These settings ensure the same tracing behavior as demonstrated in the example.

- Configure, build and flash your project as explained in the :ref:`Build the project <build the project>`.

- Click the ``ESP-IDF Explorer`` in the `Visual Studio Code Activity bar <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface>`_.

1. On the ``IDF APP TRACER`` section, click the ``Start App Trace``. This will execute the extension's OpenOCD server and send the corresponding tracing commands to generate a tracing log.

2. You can see the generated tracing log in the ``APP TRACE ARCHIVES`` named with ``Trace Log #1``.

3. Each time you execute ``Start App Trace`` a new tracing will be generated and shown in the archives list. You can also start tracing by running the **ESP-IDF: App Trace** command.

.. note::
  * The OpenOCD server output is shown in menu **View** > **Output** > **ESP-IDF**.
  * Make sure that OpenOCD configuration files are properly configured with **ESP-IDF: Select OpenOCD Board Configuration** command.

- Click on ``Trace Log #1`` to open the trace file directly in the editor.
