ESP-IDF Terminal
===============================

Navigate to **View** > **Command Palette**.

- Type **ESP-IDF: Open ESP-IDF Terminal** and select the command. 
- This will launch a system terminal with ESP-IDF, ESP-IDF Tools and ESP-IDF Python Virtual Environment loaded as environment variables.
- Just typing ``idf.py`` or ``python -m esptool`` should work to execute scripts from ESP-IDF and additional frameworks.
