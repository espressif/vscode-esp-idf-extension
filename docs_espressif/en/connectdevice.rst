Connect Your Device
===============================

In Visual Studio Code, select menu `View`, `Command Palette`, type **ESP-IDF: Select Port to Use:** and choose the serial port that your device is connected.

Please review `Establish serial communication <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html>` if you are not sure about the serial port name.
