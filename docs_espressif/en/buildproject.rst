.. note::
  There is a **idf.notificationMode** configuration setting if you do not want to see the output automatically. Please review `ESP-IDF Settings <settings>` to see how to modify this configuration setting.

You could modify the behavior of the build task with **idf.cmakeCompilerArgs** for Cmake configure step and **idf.ninjaArgs** for Ninja step. For example, using ``idf.ninjaArgs: [-j N]`` where N is the number of jobs run in parallel.

3. After building the application, the size analysis task will be executed in a terminal, showing the binaries size analysis results. You can enable or disable this task being executed with **idf.enableSizeTaskAfterBuildTask** in your settings.json.

ESP-IDF build output will try to suggest hints to solve errors that can be shown using the :ref:`Hints viewer <hints viewer>`.

Next step is to :ref:`Flash onto the device <flash the device>`.
